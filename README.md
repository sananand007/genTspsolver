# TSP Local Solver

Python implementation of different local heuristics for the TSP.

	- Current Implementation has 2-opt Algorithm 
	- Multiple Adj Matrices are being used as a single matrix with all almost 200k points causes a memory error
	- Implemented 2-opt (n^2) on top 1000 points got from optimized set

## Installation

This is a standalone library, better included directly in projects. Works with Python 3 (3.7xx)

### Optional

 * [Doctest][doctest] for running tests.
 * [Pytest][pytest] for test integration.
 * [Yapf][yapf] for code formatting.


## TODO

 * Improve LKH, some of Helsgaun work is in there but more can be added.
 * Verify that 3 works
